<TopBlock>

This guide describes how to seed your database using Prisma Client and Prisma's integrated seeding functionality (Preview). Seeding allows you to consistently re-create the same data in your database and can be used to:

- Populate your database with data that is required for your application to start - for example, a default language or a default currency.
- Provide basic data for validating and using your application in a development environment. This is particulary useful if you are using Prisma Migrate, which sometimes requires resetting your development database.

## Requirements for seeding with TypeScript or JavaScript

Prisma's integrated seeding functionality expects a command in the `"prisma"` key of your `package.json`. It should look something like this:

```json
"prisma": {
  "seed": "ts-node prisma/seed.ts"
},
```

The command can be anything. If your seed script is a Node.js script, for example, you can use:

```json
"prisma": {
  "seed": "node prisma/seed.js"
},
```

The location of the seed script is also free, although we recommend putting it in the `prisma/` folder by convention.

This is the only requirement. The next sections are recommendations on how to set up seeds with Prisma Client, but any executable command can be used.

## Seeding your database with TypeScript

To seed your database with TypeScript:

1. Create a new file named `seed.ts` in the same location as your `schema.prisma`.
2. In the `seed.ts` file, import Prisma Client, instantiate it, and create some records:

   ```ts
   import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
   const prisma = new PrismaClient()

   async function main() {
     const alice = await prisma.user.upsert({
       where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
       update: {},
       create: {
         email: 'alice@prisma.io',
         name: 'Alice',
         posts: {
           create: {
             title: 'Check out Prisma with Next.js',
             content: 'https://www.prisma.io/nextjs',
             published: true,
           },
         },
       },
     })

     const bob = await prisma.user.upsert({
       where: { email: 'bob@prisma.io' },
       update: {},
       create: {
         email: 'bob@prisma.io',
         name: 'Bob',
         posts: {
           create: [
             {
               title: 'Follow Prisma on Twitter',
               content: 'https://twitter.com/prisma',
               published: true,
             },
             {
               title: 'Follow Nexus on Twitter',
               content: 'https://twitter.com/nexusgql',
               published: true,
             },
           ],
         },
       },
     })
     console.log({ alice, bob })
   }

   main()
     .catch(e => {
       console.error(e)
       process.exit(1)
     })
     .finally(async () => {
       await prisma.$disconnect()
     })
   ```

3. Add `typescript`, `ts-node` and `@types/node` development dependencies:

   ```
   npm install -D typescript ts-node @types/node
   ```

<a id="compiler-options"></a>

4. Add the `prisma.seed` key to your project's `package.json`:

   ```js highlight=5;normal
   {
     "name": "my-project",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "prisma": {
       "seed": "ts-node --compiler-options \"{\\\"module\\\":\\\"commonjs\\\"}\" prisma/seed.ts"
     },
     "devDependencies": {
       "@types/node": "^14.14.21",
       "ts-node": "^9.1.1",
       "typescript": "^4.1.3"
     }
   }
   ```

This example shows you can add additional `--compiler-options` to the `ts-node` command if you are using tools that have specific requirements when used with TypeScript, such as Next.js.

5. To seed the database, run the `db seed` CLI command:

   ```
   prisma db seed --preview-feature
   ```

## Seeding your database with JavaScript

To seed your database with JavaScript:

1. Create a new file named `seed.js` in the same location as your `schema.prisma`.
2. In the `seed.js` file, import Prisma Client, initialize it and create some records:

   ```js
   const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')
   const prisma = new PrismaClient()

   async function main() {
     const alice = await prisma.user.upsert({
       where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
       update: {},
       create: {
         email: 'alice@prisma.io',
         name: 'Alice',
         posts: {
           create: {
             title: 'Check out Prisma with Next.js',
             content: 'https://www.prisma.io/nextjs',
             published: true,
           },
         },
       },
     })

     const bob = await prisma.user.upsert({
       where: { email: 'bob@prisma.io' },
       update: {},
       create: {
         email: 'bob@prisma.io',
         name: 'Bob',
         posts: {
           create: [
             {
               title: 'Follow Prisma on Twitter',
               content: 'https://twitter.com/prisma',
               published: true,
             },
             {
               title: 'Follow Nexus on Twitter',
               content: 'https://twitter.com/nexusgql',
               published: true,
             },
           ],
         },
       },
     })
     console.log({ alice, bob })
   }

   main()
     .catch(e => {
       console.error(e)
       process.exit(1)
     })
     .finally(async () => {
       await prisma.$disconnect()
     })
   ```

3. Add the `"seed"` key in your project's `package.json`:

   ```js highlight=5;normal
   {
     "name": "my-project",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "prisma": {
       "seed": "node prisma/seed.js"
     }
   }
   ```

4. To seed the database, run the `db seed` CLI command:

   ```
   prisma db seed --preview-feature
   ```

## Seeding your database with a Bash script

In addition to TypeScript and JavaScript, you can also use a Bash script (`seed.sh`), for example to seed your database in another language such as Go, or plain SQL.

The following example runs a Go script in the same folder as `seed.sh`:

```bash file=seed.sh
#!/bin/sh
# -e Exit immediately when a command returns a non-zero status.
# -x Print commands before they are executed
set -ex
# Seeding command
go run ./seed/
```

The following example uses [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/app-psql.html) to run a SQL script in the same folder as `seed.sh`:

```bash file=seed.sh
#!/bin/sh
# -e Exit immediately when a command returns a non-zero status.
# -x Print commands before they are executed
set -ex
# Seeding command
psql file.sql
```

In both cases, putting the command directly under `prisma.seed` in `package.json` would also work.

## Integrated seeding with Prisma Migrate

Prisma Migrate integrates seamlessly with your seeds, assuming you follow the steps in the previous section. When Prisma Migrate resets the development database, seeding is triggered automatically. Prisma Migrate resets the database and triggers seeding in the following scenarios:

- You manually run the `prisma migrate reset` CLI command.
- The database is reset interactively in the context of using `prisma migrate dev` - for example, as a result of migration history conflicts or database schema drift.
